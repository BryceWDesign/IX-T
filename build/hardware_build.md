## üîß Circuit Topology (Text Description)

1. The loop is constructed as a linear sequence of three energy ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù:
   - Each checkpoint includes a voltage divider, a sensor, and a simulated energy buffer.
   - Sensors (INA219) measure voltage and current at each checkpoint.
   - Loads (resistors) simulate energy being consumed/transferred.

2. The ESP32 communicates over I2C to each INA219 sensor, collecting:
   - Bus voltage
   - Shunt voltage
   - Current (in mA)

3. Optional: Insert external low-frequency noise source near checkpoint 2 to mimic ambient energy disturbance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Assembly Steps

1. **Power Bus Setup**  
   Connect 5V from USB supply to breadboard power rails. Include a decoupling capacitor (10 ¬µF) near the first checkpoint.

2. **Checkpoint 1 Setup**  
   - Insert 1Œ© shunt resistor.
   - Wire INA219 for shunt and bus voltage detection.
   - Attach 10Œ© load resistor post-sensor.

3. **Checkpoint 2 Setup**  
   - Repeat with new INA219 and a 10Œ© load.
   - Optional: Add antenna stub or random noise source (capacitor with nearby mobile RF interference).

4. **Checkpoint 3 Setup**  
   - Final INA219 sensor + 100Œ© load.
   - Connect output to ground.

5. **ESP32 + I2C**  
   - Wire SDA/SCL to all INA219 sensors (addressed individually via solder jumper or software).
   - Run `data_logging.py` with correct I2C addresses.

6. **Power On & Simulate**  
   Begin data logging, track checkpoint values, export CSV for analysis.

## üî¨ Simulation Notes

- This setup mimics theoretical ambient boosts by interpreting mid-loop energy readings.
- **No free energy** is claimed ‚Äî ambient interference is interpreted as simulated input.
