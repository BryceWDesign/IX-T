# Validation Protocol for IX-T Energy Loop

## Objective
To provide a rigorous experimental procedure that verifies the feasibility and performance of the IX-T energy loop prototype.

---

## 1. Preparation
- Assemble the prototype per `/docs/build_instructions.md`.
- Verify calibration of all sensors.
- Establish baseline ambient RF measurements.

## 2. Initial Energy Injection
- Power the loop with a controlled energy input.
- Record initial voltage, current, and power at all checkpoints.

## 3. Continuous Monitoring
- Log data from sensors at 1-minute intervals.
- Maintain environmental condition logs (temperature, RF background).

## 4. Data Collection Period
- Minimum continuous operation time: 72 hours.
- Ensure no additional external energy input after initial injection.

## 5. Data Analysis
- Calculate Success Metrics from `/validation/success_metrics.md`.
- Compare ESR, CHE, SI, and AOT values against thresholds.

## 6. Reporting
- Document all results, anomalies, and environmental factors.
- Provide raw data logs and processed results.

## 7. Reproducibility
- Repeat the protocol at least 3 independent trials.
- Confirm consistency of results across trials.

## 8. Peer Review and Transparency
- Share all experimental setup details and data publicly.
- Invite feedback and independent replication.

## Conclusion
Following this protocol ensures scientific rigor and transparency, strengthening the credibility of the IX-T prototype validation.
