## 1. Energy Harvesting Metrics

| Metric                     | Description                                  | Target Value            | Measurement Method           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Net Energy Gain            | Total harvested energy minus system losses  | > 0 V (positive gain)  | Integrated voltage/current monitoring |
| Conversion Efficiency      | Ratio of harvested to ambient energy         | ≥ 20%                  | Controlled lab testing       |
| Checkpoint Recharge Rate   | Energy added to current at each checkpoint   | ≥ 0.1 V per cycle      | Sensor data logs             |
