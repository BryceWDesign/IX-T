# Success Metrics for IX-T Energy Loop Validation

## Purpose
Define quantitative and qualitative metrics to objectively evaluate the performance and feasibility of the IX-T energy loop prototype.

---

## 1. Energy Sustainment Ratio (ESR)
- **Definition:** Ratio of energy output to energy input over a fixed period.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  ESR = \frac{\text{Total Energy Output (Joules)}}{\text{Total Energy Input (Joules)}}
  \]
- **Success Threshold:** ESR ≥ 1.0 over 48 hours, indicating sustained or growing energy.

## 2. Checkpoint Harvesting Efficiency (CHE)
- **Definition:** Percentage of total energy losses recovered by energy checkpoints.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  CHE = \frac{\text{Energy Harvested by Checkpoints}}{\text{Total Energy Losses}} \times 100\%
  \]
- **Success Threshold:** CHE ≥ 90%.

## 3. Stability Index (SI)
- **Definition:** Measure of energy fluctuation variance within the loop.
- **Calculation:** Statistical variance of energy measurements normalized by mean energy.
- **Success Threshold:** SI ≤ 0.05, indicating stable energy flow.

## 4. Autonomous Operation Time (AOT)
- **Definition:** Duration the loop operates without external energy injection after initial startup.
- **Success Threshold:** AOT ≥ 48 hours.

## 5. Environmental Impact Considerations
- Monitor ambient RF interference and temperature impacts to ensure repeatability.

## Conclusion
Meeting or exceeding these metrics will provide strong validation that the IX-T loop is functionally sustaining or increasing its energy state, supporting claims of feasibility.
