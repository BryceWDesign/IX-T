# Success Metrics for IX-T Energy Loop Project

## Objective
Define clear, quantifiable metrics to evaluate the performance, feasibility, and success of the IX-T project both in simulation and potential real-world application.

---

## 1. Energy Sustainment Ratio (ESR)
- **Definition:** Ratio of energy maintained in the loop after each cycle compared to initial energy.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  ESR = \frac{E_{n}}{E_0}
  \]  
  where \(E_n\) is energy at cycle n, \(E_0\) initial energy.
- **Success Threshold:** ESR ≥ 1 over extended cycles indicates no net energy loss.

## 2. Ambient Energy Harvest Efficiency (AEHE)
- **Definition:** Percentage of ambient energy successfully harvested and injected back into the loop.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  AEHE = \frac{E_{harvested}}{E_{ambient\_available}} \times 100\%
  \]
- **Target:** Achieving AEHE ≥ 10% demonstrates practical harvesting efficacy.

## 3. Loss Compensation Ratio (LCR)
- **Definition:** Ratio of ambient energy harvested to total circuit losses.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  LCR = \frac{E_{harvested}}{E_{losses}}
  \]
- **Success Condition:** LCR ≥ 1 means ambient harvesting fully compensates losses.

## 4. Checkpoint Contribution Consistency (CCC)
- **Definition:** Stability of energy contributions from each checkpoint over time.
- **Measurement:** Variance in energy input across cycles should be minimal.
- **Importance:** Ensures reliability of checkpoints in maintaining energy balance.

## 5. System Efficiency (η)
- **Definition:** Overall efficiency considering all inputs and losses.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  η = \frac{E_{output}}{E_{input}} \times 100\%
  \]
- **Ideal Outcome:** Efficiency > 70% for a sustainable loop in realistic conditions.
