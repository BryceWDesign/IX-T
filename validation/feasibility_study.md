# Feasibility Study for IX-T Energy Loop Project

## Introduction

This study reviews the theoretical and practical aspects of the IX-T energy loop concept.

## Theoretical Foundations

- Conservation of Energy: Recognizes that the system must obey fundamental physics laws.
- Checkpoint Boost Mechanism: Explores mechanisms for energy recharge at checkpoints.
- Ambient Energy Harvesting: Discusses integrating ambient RF energy (e.g., WiFi antenna arrays) as potential input.

## Practical Challenges

- Losses due to Resistance and Heat
- Sensor and Circuit Precision
- Material Limitations
- Environmental Interference

## Simulation Outcomes

- Simulations indicate that with >1.0 efficiency at checkpoints, energy growth is theoretically possible.
- However, real-world losses often reduce efficiency below 1.0, limiting net gain.

## Conclusion

While theoretical models are promising, significant engineering challenges remain. Further experimental validation is required to confirm practical viability.
