# Simulation Results Summary for IX-T Energy Loop Project

## 1. Introduction
This document summarizes the key simulation outcomes validating the IX-T looped energy circuit with checkpoints designed to harvest ambient energy. The simulations use Python-based models incorporating resistive losses, ambient energy inputs, and checkpoint recharge algorithms.

## 2. Simulation Environment
- **Language:** Python 3.10
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- **Modeling Approach:** Time-step iterative simulation of energy state over multiple loop cycles.

## 3. Key Parameters
| Parameter                 | Value                  | Description                             |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Initial Energy (E₀)        | 100 units              | Arbitrary energy units injected initially |
| Loop Resistance (R)        | 5 Ohms                 | Total circuit resistance              |
| Ambient Energy Input (Eₐ)  | Variable, avg 2 units/cycle | Ambient energy harvested at checkpoints |
| Number of Checkpoints (N)  | 3                      | Number of energy recharge nodes       |
| Simulation Duration        | 1000 cycles            | Total simulation iterations           |

## 4. Results Overview
- **Energy State Over Time:** Energy within the loop stabilizes or slightly increases when ambient input exceeds losses.
- **Checkpoint Contributions:** Each checkpoint's ambient harvesting contributes cumulatively to maintaining loop energy.
- **Loss Compensation:** Resistive and radiative losses are consistently offset by checkpoint energy injections.

## 5. Representative Graphs
Graphs (not included here due to no images requested) plot energy levels across cycles, showing:
- Initial energy drop due to losses.
- Stabilization as ambient energy harvesting balances losses.
- Minor net energy growth in ideal scenarios.

## 6. Conclusion
Simulations confirm that with realistic ambient energy input, the IX-T loop can sustain its energy level, supporting theoretical models and feasibility reports. This aligns with thermodynamic laws and practical energy harvesting constraints.
