# IX-T Validation Plan

## Objective

To define a rigorous methodology for experimentally validating the IX-T ambient energy harvesting system, ensuring reproducible and quantifiable proof of concept.

---

## 1. Validation Goals

- Verify energy harvesting efficiency at each checkpoint.  
- Demonstrate net positive energy gain in a closed-loop configuration.  
- Characterize system stability and endurance over extended operation.  
- Measure environmental impact and sensitivity (temperature, RF intensity, vibration frequency).  

---

## 2. Experimental Setup

- **Prototype:** Fully assembled IX-T hardware prototype with all three harvesters and sensors.  
- **Instrumentation:** High-precision digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, data loggers, and environmental sensors.  
- **Test Environment:** Controlled lab conditions initially, followed by real-world ambient settings.

## 3. Test Procedures

| Test Case                  | Description                                                      | Metrics Measured              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Baseline Harvesting        | Measure energy output of each harvester individually             | Voltage, current, power      |
| Closed-Loop Operation      | Run the circuit continuously and monitor net energy              | Net energy gain/loss, stability |
| Environmental Sensitivity  | Vary temperature, RF intensity, vibration amplitude              | Change in energy output       |
| Long-Term Endurance        | Operate system continuously for >48 hours                        | Degradation, failures, drift |

## 4. Metrics of Success

- **Energy Gain:** System should demonstrate net positive energy output over baseline losses.  
- **Stability:** Less than 5% variance in energy output over 24-hour intervals.  
- **Efficiency:** Achieve >20% conversion efficiency in at least one ambient source.  
- **Reliability:** No critical hardware or firmware failures during endurance tests.

---

## 5. Data Analysis

- Use time-series analysis to identify trends and anomalies.  
- Compare simulated energy models with measured data for calibration.  
- Statistical validation to ensure significance of observed gains.

---

## 6. Documentation & Reporting

- Maintain detailed logs of all experiments with timestamps and environmental conditions.  
- Publish raw data and processed results in the GitHub repository for transparency.  
- Provide open-access protocols for independent replication.

This validation plan ensures that IX-T moves beyond conceptual simulation into robust, verifiable science.
