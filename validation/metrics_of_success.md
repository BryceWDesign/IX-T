# Metrics of Success for IX-T Project

This document defines clear, objective criteria to evaluate the success and feasibility of the IX-T energy loop system.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Energy Retention Rate**  
   - The system should retain at least 95% of the initial energy per complete loop without external input.

2. **Energy Amplification Factor**  
   - Demonstrable increase in energy after passing through all checkpoints, targeting a minimum 5% energy boost per checkpoint.

3. **Stability Over Time**  
   - Energy levels must remain stable or increase over 100+ simulation cycles without decay.

4. **Sensor Accuracy**  
   - Voltage and current sensors must have less than 1% measurement error.

5. **System Response Time**  
   - Control loop should operate within the defined sampling interval without lag.

## Verification Methods

- Continuous monitoring and logging via firmware sensors.
- Simulation models running varied parameters.
- Data analysis of logged real-time sensor data.
- Statistical validation of sensor calibration.

Achieving these metrics supports the claim of a self-sustaining or energy-amplifying loop system.
