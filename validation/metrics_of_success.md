# Metrics of Success for IX-T Ambient Energy Harvesting System

This document outlines the key measurable outcomes and criteria that indicate the IX-T system is functioning as intended and demonstrates feasibility for ambient energy harvesting with checkpoint amplification.

---

## 1. Energy Stability and Sustainability

- **Stable Voltage Levels:** Each checkpoint in the energy loop maintains or increases voltage levels without degradation over extended monitoring periods (e.g., 24+ hours).  
- **Consistent Current Flow:** Current measurements remain steady or increase, indicating successful energy harvesting and checkpoint boosting.

---

## 2. Power Output Growth

- **Power Gain at Checkpoints:** Power (mW) at each checkpoint should show measurable increases compared to input harvester baseline, demonstrating checkpoint "charging" effect.  
- **Energy Loop Sustainability:** The system should maintain power flow without external input (besides ambient energy harvesters), proving the circuit’s closed-loop efficacy.

## 3. Efficiency Metrics

- **Harvesting Efficiency:** Ratio of electrical power output at each checkpoint relative to theoretical ambient energy input estimates (based on component specs).  
- **Boost Converter Efficiency:** Monitor input vs output power for boost converters to ensure minimal losses.

---

## 4. Data Logging and Monitoring

- **Continuous Data Capture:** Sensor data logged every 5 seconds without gaps or anomalies.  
- **Error Rates:** No sensor read errors or communication failures over test periods.

---

## 5. Simulation Validation

- **Model Accuracy:** Simulation results (e.g., from Python scripts) correlate closely with measured hardware data within expected tolerances.  
- **Scenario Testing:** Simulated responses to variable ambient energy inputs confirm system robustness.
