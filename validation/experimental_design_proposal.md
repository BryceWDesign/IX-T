# Experimental Design Proposal for IX-T Energy Loop Validation

## Objective
Outline a step-by-step experimental framework to validate the IX-T concept under controlled laboratory or field conditions.

---

## 1. Experimental Setup

- **Test Circuit:** Physical prototype replicating the IX-T loop with three energy checkpoints.
- **Energy Sources:** Initial power burst and ambient RF energy harvesting antennas integrated at checkpoints.
- **Measurement Equipment:**  
  - High-precision voltmeters and ammeters  
  - Oscilloscopes for waveform analysis  
  - Data acquisition system for continuous monitoring

## 2. Procedure

1. **Initialization:** Inject a known energy quantity into the loop.
2. **Checkpoint Calibration:** Tune checkpoint ambient energy harvesting devices for maximum efficiency.
3. **Run Duration:** Continuous operation for 48-72 hours to capture long-term behavior.
4. **Data Logging:** Record voltage, current, and power at multiple points in the loop every second.
5. **Environmental Monitoring:** Track ambient RF levels, temperature, and interference.

## 3. Data Analysis

- Calculate energy sustainment ratio and checkpoint contributions over time.
- Compare energy lost due to resistance and radiative effects versus energy harvested.
- Evaluate stability and fluctuations in loop energy.

## 4. Success Criteria

- Loop energy remains stable or increases over test duration.
- Checkpoint harvested energy compensates for at least 90% of losses.
- System operates autonomously without external input beyond ambient energy after initial injection.

## 5. Safety and Risk Management

- Shield sensitive equipment from interference.
- Use low-voltage power levels to avoid hazards.
- Maintain detailed logs for reproducibility.

## 6. Conclusion

This experimental design offers a rigorous, practical approach to validate the IX-T concept, bridging simulation with empirical evidence.
