# IX-T: Simulated Ambient Energy Loop Technology

## Overview

IX-T is a conceptual Python simulation modeling a closed-loop ambient energy system. It demonstrates the theoretical idea of an energy loop with checkpoints that replenish energy to offset decay, inspired by ambient energy harvesting theories.

This project is intended strictly for academic and conceptual exploration by researchers, engineers, physicists, and technologists interested in energy systems and advanced theoretical models.

## Features

- Configurable initial energy, decay rate, and checkpoint boosts.
- Simulates energy loss and recovery over discrete steps.
- Modular design with separate components for loop logic and checkpoints.
- Includes test suites validating core simulation logic.
- Detailed documentation including system specs and topology overview.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IX-T.git
   cd IX-T
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install required packages (none required for core simulation, standard library only).

---

## Usage

1. Customize the simulation parameters in `data/sample_config.json`.
2. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py --config data/sample_config.json
   ```

3. Observe console output showing energy decay and checkpoint boosts per step.

## Disclaimer

IX-T is a simulation-based model with design & behavior that has been validated through internal data analysis. 
While it has not yet been physically implemented or tested in real-world environments due to my current financial ability to contribute further; the system's performance is grounded in consistent and repeatable simulation results. 
This model is intended for conceptual exploration and educational use.
