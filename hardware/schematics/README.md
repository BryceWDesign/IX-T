# Hardware Schematics Overview

This folder contains all hardware design documentation required to build the IX-T prototype from concept to physical reality.

## Contents

- Detailed circuit diagrams illustrating component interconnections.
- Wiring diagrams for assembly guidance.
- PCB layout files compatible with KiCad.
- Explanation of component roles and interaction with firmware.
- Notes on power supply, signal routing, and safety considerations.

---

## Objective

Provide a fully detailed and professional hardware blueprint that enables expert engineers to fabricate and assemble the IX-T system without guesswork.

---

## Next Steps

Subsequent files will include:

- Individual circuit schematic files (.sch)
- PCB layout files (.kicad_pcb)
- Wiring diagrams (.pdf or .svg format text equivalents)
- Firmware control code in Python for microcontroller management
- Assembly and testing instructions
