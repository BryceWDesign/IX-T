IX-T Wiring Diagram Overview
============================

This file details the wiring connections between major components of the IX-T prototype circuit.

Components:
- Energy Loop Circuit Board (main PCB)
- Checkpoint Modules (3 units)
- Power Supply Unit (regulated 5V)
- Microcontroller Board (Raspberry Pi Pico)
- Data Logger Module (SD Card Interface)
- Sensor Array (Voltage, Current sensors)

Wiring Instructions:
1. Connect Power Supply Unit 5V output to the main PCB power input.
2. Wire checkpoint modules in series along the energy loop path.
3. Connect each checkpoint module to the microcontroller analog input pins for monitoring.
4. Connect sensor outputs to designated analog inputs on the microcontroller.
5. Connect data logger SPI pins to microcontroller SPI interface.
6. Ground all modules and components to common ground bus on the main PCB.
7. Use shielded cables for sensor signals to reduce noise.

Cable Color Coding (recommended):
- Red: +5V power lines
- Black: Ground
- Blue: Signal lines

Notes:
- Maintain short wire lengths to reduce resistance and noise.
- Use secure connectors to avoid intermittent contact.
- Follow standard ESD precautions when assembling.

This wiring guide will be accompanied by PCB layouts and physical assembly instructions in subsequent files.
