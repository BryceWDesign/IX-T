# RF-to-DC Converter Circuit ‚Äì Design Explanation

This document explains the operation of the RF-to-DC converter circuit shown in `rf_to_dc_circuit.svg`. This subsystem allows the IX-T drone to harvest ambient RF energy (e.g., from checkpoint beacons or strong field emitters) and convert it into stored DC power for the battery system.

## üîã Expected Output

- Input RF power: -10 dBm to +10 dBm (typical in near field)
- Output Voltage (after BQ25570): ~3.3V DC regulated
- Charge Current: ~10‚Äì50 mA depending on signal strength and antenna gain

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Tips

- The antenna must be tuned for the expected RF band (e.g. 915 MHz ISM).
- Keep traces short and impedance-matched at RF stages.
- Use shielded compartments for high-sensitivity sections.
- Place BQ25570 close to the output of the rectifier for minimal loss.
- Use ground pours and proper decoupling caps.
