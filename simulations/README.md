# Simulations for IX-T Project

This directory contains Python scripts that simulate the energy loop concept.

## Contents

- `energy_loop_simulation.py`: Models the energy current through checkpoints with configurable efficiency and decay.

## Purpose

These simulations aim to provide a computational model to test whether energy input at checkpoints can sustain or amplify energy in a closed loop system under simplified assumptions.

## Usage

Run the scripts to visualize energy trends over time and adjust parameters to explore feasibility scenarios.
