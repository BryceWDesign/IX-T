# Firmware Overview for IX-T Prototype

This folder contains all firmware source code required to operate and monitor the IX-T prototype system.

## Contents

- Python control scripts for the microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython)
- Sensor data acquisition and checkpoint energy monitoring modules
- Data logging routines to record real-time voltage and current measurements
- Communication interfaces for potential remote telemetry
- Configuration files for calibration and threshold settings

---

## Objective

Provide clean, modular, and well-documented Python code to ensure precise control and data collection during prototype operation.

---

## Next Steps

Subsequent files will include:

- Main control script (`main.py`)
- Sensor reading utilities (`sensors.py`)
- Data logging module (`logger.py`)
- Configuration and calibration files (`config.py`)

---

This README should be referenced before working with individual firmware files.
