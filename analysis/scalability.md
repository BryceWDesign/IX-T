# IX-T Scalability Analysis

## Purpose

To assess how the IX-T ambient energy harvesting system performs as the scale of the deployment grows, including energy yield, complexity, cost implications, and practical deployment scenarios.

---

## 1. Scaling Factors

- **Number of Checkpoints:** Increasing checkpoints can improve total harvested energy but adds hardware complexity and costs.
- **Harvester Density:** More antennas or thermal/vibration harvesters per checkpoint can increase energy capture.
- **Area Coverage:** Deploying IX-T circuits over larger physical areas allows harvesting from spatially diverse ambient sources.
- **Integration Density:** Compact designs reduce installation footprint but may affect thermal dissipation and vibration isolation.

## 2. Energy Yield vs Complexity

| Scale Level     | Checkpoints | Harvesters per Checkpoint | Estimated Energy Output (mW) | Complexity & Cost Implication    |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Small (Prototype) | 3           | 1 each                   | 10-20                       | Low: simple modular setup       |
| Medium          | 10          | 3 each                   | 100-150                     | Moderate: increased wiring and management |
| Large           | 50+         | 5+ each                  | 500+                        | High: requires robust control systems and maintenance |

## 3. Cost Considerations

- **Component Costs:** Energy harvesters vary from $5 (basic piezo) to $50+ (advanced RF modules).  
- **Manufacturing:** Custom PCB and enclosure fabrication add fixed costs that amortize better at scale.  
- **Maintenance:** Larger systems require more frequent calibration and repair.

---

## 4. Deployment Scenarios

- **Remote Sensors:** Low-power IoT devices benefiting from ambient energy to extend battery life.  
- **Wearables:** Harvesting thermal and vibration energy from human body movements.  
- **Smart Infrastructure:** Embedding harvesters in buildings or vehicles for auxiliary power.

## 5. Recommendations

- Start with small-scale prototypes to validate energy yields before scaling.  
- Use modular, plug-and-play hardware to facilitate incremental expansion.  
- Incorporate advanced power management to optimize harvested energy usage.  
- Explore hybrid harvesting combining multiple ambient sources for robustness.

---

## 6. Future Work

- Develop cost models specific to targeted applications.  
- Simulate environmental impact on large-scale deployments.  
- Assess integration strategies with existing power grids or storage solutions.
