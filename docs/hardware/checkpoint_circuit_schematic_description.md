# Checkpoint Charging Circuit Schematic Description

This document explains the schematic design and functional flow of the checkpoint charging circuit.

## Overview

The checkpoint charging circuit is designed to harvest ambient RF energy using antennas, convert it into usable DC voltage, and inject this energy back into the circulating energy loop at strategic points (checkpoints) to sustain or boost the overall energy.

## Schematic Blocks

1. **RF Energy Harvesting Antennas:**  
   Multiple wideband antennas capture ambient RF signals across various frequencies.

2. **Bridge Rectifier:**  
   Converts the alternating RF signals into DC voltage with minimal loss, utilizing low forward-voltage Schottky diodes to maximize efficiency.

3. **Boost Converter Module:**  
   Steps up the low DC voltage from the rectifier to a higher, stable voltage level suitable for energy injection into the loop.

4. **Energy Storage Capacitor:**  
   Smooths out voltage fluctuations and provides instantaneous power delivery capability.

5. **MOSFET Switching:**  
   Acts as a controlled switch to inject energy into the main energy loop based on PWM control signals from the microcontroller.

6. **Microcontroller:**  
   Provides intelligent control by monitoring voltage and current sensors, adjusting MOSFET switching duty cycle to optimize energy injection while preventing overloading.

7. **Sensors:**  
   Voltage and current sensors feed real-time data to the microcontroller to maintain system stability and efficiency.

## Functional Flow

- Antennas collect ambient RF energy, which is converted to DC by the rectifier.  
- Boost converter amplifies this voltage to a usable level.  
- The capacitor stores energy and smooths output voltage.  
- The microcontroller modulates MOSFET switching to inject energy into the loop dynamically, based on sensor feedback.  
- This feedback loop ensures energy is injected only when beneficial, maintaining system stability.

## Notes

- The design assumes ambient RF energy availability; performance varies with environment.  
- Component values and configurations can be tuned based on specific application requirements.  
- Proper PCB layout and shielding are critical to minimize noise and maximize efficiency.
