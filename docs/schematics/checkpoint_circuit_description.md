# Checkpoint Charging Circuit Description

## Overview
This document details the design and operation of the checkpoint charging circuitry used in the IX-T energy loop system. The checkpoints are responsible for harvesting ambient energy and boosting the energy current flowing in the loop to maintain or amplify the overall system energy.

## Circuit Components
- **Energy Harvesting Antenna Array:** Multiple WiFi and RF antennas configured to capture ambient RF energy.
- **Rectifier Circuit:** Converts the AC signal from antennas into DC voltage suitable for charging.
- **Boost Converter Module:** Increases the harvested DC voltage to a usable level for injection into the energy loop.
- **Energy Storage Capacitor:** Temporarily stores harvested energy before release.
- **Switching Control (MOSFET):** Regulates timing and amount of energy injected into the loop.
- **Voltage and Current Sensors:** Monitor checkpoint output to ensure controlled charging.

## Functional Description
1. **Ambient Energy Capture:** Antenna arrays receive electromagnetic signals and convert them to small AC currents.
2. **Rectification:** The AC current is rectified to DC using a high-efficiency Schottky diode bridge.
3. **Boost Conversion:** The low voltage DC is boosted via a switching DC-DC converter to a target voltage.
4. **Energy Storage:** A capacitor smooths and stores the boosted voltage.
5. **Controlled Injection:** The MOSFET switch releases stored energy into the energy loop at controlled intervals.
6. **Feedback and Monitoring:** Sensors continuously measure voltage and current to optimize injection timing and magnitude.

## Design Considerations
- Antenna tuning for maximum ambient frequency capture.
- Efficient rectifier and boost converter to minimize losses.
- Safe operating limits to prevent overcharging or damage.
- Modular design for scalability with multiple checkpoints.

## Integration Notes
- Connect checkpoint output to the designated node in the main energy loop circuit.
- Sensor outputs feed into the data logging system for real-time monitoring.
- Power and ground lines must be carefully managed to reduce noise.
