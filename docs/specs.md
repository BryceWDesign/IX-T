# IX-T: Simulated Ambient Energy Loop

## Overview
IX-T is a Python-based simulation that models a theoretical ambient energy loop. It simulates a closed-loop energy circuit with configurable energy decay and periodic energy reinjection through **checkpoints**.

This project is intended for conceptual demonstration only â€” no physical execution is expected.

---

## Architecture

- **Energy Loop**: Central mechanism representing continuous energy flow, subjected to decay over time.
- **Checkpoints**: Inject energy at defined points in the loop to maintain or restore system viability.
- **Configurable Parameters**: JSON-driven tuning for experimentation.

---

## Simulation Flow

1. Start with an initial energy value.
2. At each step:
   - Apply energy decay.
   - Reintroduce energy via checkpoints.
   - Log current energy state.

## System Behavior

| Parameter         | Description                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `initial_energy` | Total energy to start with              |
| `loss_factor`    | Percentage lost per cycle (0-1 float)   |
| `checkpoints`    | List of injection points with boost amt |
| `simulation_steps` | Number of steps to simulate          |

## Purpose

- Model and visualize cyclic energy preservation.
- Demonstrate checkpoint-assisted loss compensation.
- Provide a research-oriented concept for review by physicists, engineers, and technologists.

---

## Limitations

- Not tied to physical components or real hardware.
- No dynamic adjustment of decay or adaptive control.
- No persistent state beyond simulation runtime.

---

## Intended Use

This repository exists for academic and conceptual discussion of closed-loop energy dynamics augmented by periodic compensation. It may support conversations about hypothetical ambient energy systems.
