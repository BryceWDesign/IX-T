# Validation Protocol for IX-T Energy Loop Prototype

## Objective
To verify the theoretical claims of the IX-T energy loop through systematic measurement, data logging, and analysis.

## Procedure

1. **Setup**
   - Assemble the prototype according to wiring and assembly instructions.
   - Calibrate voltage and current sensors using known references.

2. **Baseline Measurement**
   - Power the system without activating checkpoint charging.
   - Record baseline energy loss over 100 cycles.

3. **Checkpoint Activation**
   - Enable energy input at checkpoints as per design.
   - Record voltage, current, and energy values continuously for at least 24 hours.

4. **Data Logging**
   - Ensure continuous data capture with timestamped entries.
   - Backup data periodically.

5. **Data Analysis**
   - Calculate energy retention and net gain metrics.
   - Compare with simulation results for consistency.

6. **Repetition**
   - Repeat tests under varying environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).
   - Document all observations.

## Reporting

- Compile all data, graphs, and findings in a detailed report.
- Highlight any deviations from expected behavior.
- Provide recommendations for design improvements or further testing.
