## üß© 1. Prototype Development

### Goals:
- Build a low-power closed-loop system with 3 checkpoint modules
- Use harvesters for RF, thermal, and vibration energy sources
- Integrate real-time monitoring with energy capture/decay logging

### Required Components:
- ESP32 microcontroller or similar low-power board
- Piezoelectric vibration harvester
- Thermoelectric generator (TEC1 or similar)
- RF harvester + antenna array
- Supercapacitor bank
- Power management ICs (LDOs, buck/boost converters)

## üî¨ 2. Simulated Environment Testing

### Testbeds:
- Thermally controlled chamber (for cyclic ambient heat testing)
- RF-isolated enclosure (to establish ambient baseline)
- Vibrational plate rig (for mechanical energy testing)

### Objectives:
- Validate energy gain/loss per cycle
- Observe resilience to ambient fluctuations
- Record loop longevity improvements
