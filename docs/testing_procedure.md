# Testing Procedure for IX-T Energy Loop Prototype

## Purpose
To validate energy retention and net gain through systematic testing.

## Step 1: Setup Verification
- Confirm all components are properly connected as per build instructions.
- Verify sensors respond correctly with baseline measurements.

## Step 2: Baseline Energy Loss Test
- Run the circuit without activating checkpoint energy inputs.
- Log sensor data continuously for 100 cycles.
- Analyze data to quantify natural energy loss.

## Step 3: Checkpoint Energy Input Test
- Activate checkpoint charging mechanism.
- Continue logging data for at least 24 hours.
- Monitor voltage and current values at each checkpoint.

## Step 4: Data Collection and Backup
- Ensure all sensor data is saved onto the SD card with timestamps.
- Create multiple backups of collected data for analysis.

## Step 5: Data Analysis
- Compare baseline loss data with checkpoint-enabled data.
- Calculate net energy gain or loss over cycles.
- Use provided analysis scripts for consistency.

## Step 6: Environmental Variations
- Repeat tests under different ambient conditions (temperature, humidity).
- Document all changes and effects.
