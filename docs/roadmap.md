# IX-T Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the path from a simulated ambient energy loop to a real-world prototype and potential future application.

## ðŸ§ª Phase 1: Simulation Refinement (Complete)

- [x] Build modular simulation loop in Python
- [x] Implement configurable decay, checkpoints, and boosts
- [x] Validate internal logic against energy constraints
- [x] Provide simulation output and metrics of success

---

## ðŸ”¬ Phase 2: Experimental Hardware

**Objective:** Create a basic physical circuit that mimics the simulation using known ambient energy harvesting technologies.

### Tasks:
- Design low-draw closed loop using microcontrollers and capacitors
- Integrate 3 ambient energy harvesting methods:
  - RF antenna harvesting (e.g., using Powercast or custom antenna array)
  - Thermoelectric modules (e.g., Peltier-based differentials)
  - Piezoelectric elements (vibration-based input)
- Use analog + digital sensors to measure decay and recharge
- Log data using onboard storage for analysis

## ðŸ”Œ Phase 3: Field Testing

**Objective:** Test sustained energy loops in controlled environments.

### Environments:
- Isolated lab space (low EM noise)
- Outdoor/urban zones (RF-rich zones)
- Faraday caged zone (baseline noise comparison)

### Metrics:
- Energy longevity under load
- Boost repeatability and signal capture efficiency
- Environmental impact on energy loop performance

## ðŸš€ Phase 4: Extended Vision

**Ambitious Goals:**
- Autonomous sensor loops that operate indefinitely on ambient energy
- Use in deep-space micro-systems (low-resource energy platforms)
- Integration into smart cities for passive sensor networks

---

## ðŸ’¼ Resources Required

- RF harvesting modules and custom antenna arrays
- Small-scale energy storage components (supercaps, graphene batteries)
- Oscilloscopes, RF signal analyzers, field testers
- Private testing facility or mobile testing lab

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Research Directions

- Adaptive checkpoint logic (boost when energy nears critical threshold)
- Environmental signal forecasting and AI-based tuning
- Energy currency/tokenized loop models (for distributed device networks)
