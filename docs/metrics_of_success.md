## ⚙️ Technical Metrics

| Metric                         | Description                                                 | Success Threshold              |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Energy offset ratio           | Harvested / lost energy per loop                            | ≥ 50% consistently             |
| Operational extension factor  | Cycles gained before reaching 50% energy vs baseline        | ≥ 2× improvement               |
| Loop latency increase         | Additional delay introduced by checkpoint logic             | ≤ 10% of original loop latency |
| Overhead power cost           | Power consumed by checkpoint logic itself                   | ≤ 5% of harvested energy       |

## 📈 Modeling Benchmarks (from `/models/power_gain_analysis.py`)

- **Target**: Total net energy should increase after 20+ cycles in a simulated ambient environment
- **Evidence**: Current model shows 2.6x lifespan improvement with modest input
- **Metric Trigger**: Further optimization possible if checkpoint yield > 0.025 units/cycle

## 💡 Prototype Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                       | Description                            | Success Indicator              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Prototype cost              | Total build cost per unit              | ≤ $150                        |
| Scaled deployment trial     | Number of units in testbed             | ≥ 5                           |
| Measurement repeatability   | Standard deviation of energy trends    | ≤ 10% across trials           |

## ✅ Success Summary

The IX-T system is successful when it:
- **Offsets at least half of energy lost per loop**
- **At least doubles circuit lifespan**
- **Operates on harvested energy >70% of time**
- **Can be built, tested, and measured reliably**

Achieving these metrics would signal to investors and scientists alike that IX-T is a viable energy resilience mechanism worthy of further development and support.
