# Metrics of Success for IX-T Energy Loop Prototype

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Energy Retention Ratio**  
   - Definition: Percentage of energy retained after each loop cycle.  
   - Target: ≥ 90% retention per cycle to demonstrate minimal losses.

2. **Net Energy Gain at Checkpoints**  
   - Definition: Amount of energy added by checkpoints relative to energy lost.  
   - Target: Net positive gain after each full cycle.

3. **System Stability**  
   - Definition: Ability to maintain steady-state energy levels without oscillation or collapse.  
   - Target: Stable energy levels for at least 100 cycles.

4. **Data Accuracy and Reliability**  
   - Sensor readings must be consistent within ±5% error margin.  
   - Logging system must operate without data loss.

## Testing Protocol

- Run the prototype continuously for 24 hours, logging energy values at each checkpoint.  
- Compare logged data to simulation results for validation.  
- Analyze data to confirm if energy growth or retention targets are met.

## Acceptance Criteria

- If the prototype shows net energy gain or stable retention over prolonged operation, it supports the theoretical model.  
- Inconclusive or negative results require review of design and components.
