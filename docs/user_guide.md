# IX-T User Guide and Build Instructions

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for assembling, configuring, running, and testing the IX-T ambient energy harvesting system. It targets engineers, researchers, and technical stakeholders.

---

## 1. Hardware Assembly

### Components Required

- Energy Harvesters (RF, thermal, vibration modules)  
- Microcontroller (recommended: Raspberry Pi Pico or Arduino Nano)  
- Power management circuitry (boost converters, regulators)  
- Connectors and wiring harness  
- Enclosure (optional, for protection)

### Assembly Steps

1. Mount energy harvesters at designated checkpoints on the circuit loop.  
2. Connect harvesters to the microcontroller input pins via the power management circuit.  
3. Ensure correct polarity and secure connections to prevent shorts.  
4. Install sensors (voltage/current) at each checkpoint for monitoring.  
5. Encapsulate assembly in enclosure if deploying in environmental conditions.

## 2. Software Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed on host machine  
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`  
- Access to microcontroller programming interface (USB or serial)

### Installation

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

### Deployment

1. Upload firmware code to microcontroller (see `/hardware/firmware` folder).  
2. Connect microcontroller to host machine via USB.  
3. Run simulation and monitoring scripts (e.g., `simulation_runner.py`).

## 3. Running the System

- Power on the system and ensure microcontroller boots correctly.  
- Monitor live voltage and current readings via serial console or logging interface.  
- Observe energy flow between checkpoints and overall system stability.

---

## 4. Testing and Validation

- Follow `/validation/validation_plan.md` for detailed experimental protocols.  
- Log data continuously during tests for post-analysis.  
- Compare logged data with simulation outputs to validate accuracy.

---

## 5. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

- Regularly inspect physical connections and harvesters for wear.  
- Recalibrate sensors every 3 months or after hardware modifications.  
- Address firmware bugs by reviewing logs and updating codebase.

---

## 6. Safety and Compliance

- Ensure enclosure prevents exposure to electrical contacts.  
- Verify components operate within specified voltage/current ratings.  
- Follow local regulations for RF and thermal devices.
