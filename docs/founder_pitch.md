# IX-T Founder Pitch

## 🚀 Concept

IX-T is a simulation of a sustained energy flow system, exploring how ambient energy harvesting can offset decay in closed-loop circuits. It's not a perpetual motion machine. It is a blueprint for real-world systems that thrive on environmental energy.

## 💡 Inspiration

- What if small energy boosts at key points could radically prolong the lifespan of a signal or device?
- What if micro-networks could run indefinitely on the energy around them?
- What if the principles behind smart energy systems were reimagined at the circuit level?

## 🧠 What We Did

We built:
- A Python simulation modeling decay and recovery using checkpoint logic
- A testable, bounded loop — no fantasy physics
- Metrics of success, output samples, validation frameworks
- A roadmap from code to real-world energy harvesting systems

## 🎯 Vision

We want to bring this simulation to life — to test how ambient energy (RF, heat, vibration) can power low-draw microcircuits autonomously. Applications include:
- Remote sensors with infinite lifespan
- Spacecraft with loop-powered instruments
- IoT networks running on the air around them

## 🛠 What We Need

To build this in the real world, we need:
- Custom RF harvesting arrays
- Precision instrumentation
- A private testing facility (urban + RF-isolated)
- Team members from physics, materials science, and electrical engineering

## 🤝 Why You?

Because you don’t ignore strange ideas — you mine them for potential.
Because if this works, it changes how we think about passive power forever.

IX-T is a new class of simulation: plausible, modular, and provocatively real.
