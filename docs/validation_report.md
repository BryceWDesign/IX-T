# IX-T Validation Report

## Purpose

The purpose of IX-T is to explore the feasibility of maintaining energy flow in a closed-loop system with assistive energy checkpoints. While not a perpetual motion machine, the project simulates theoretically plausible scenarios where ambient energy is harvested to offset natural energy decay.

## Core Assumptions

1. **Energy Decay is Real and Constant**  
   All simulations include a decay factor representing resistive losses, inefficiency, and entropy.

2. **Checkpoints Mimic Real-World Energy Harvesting**  
   Each checkpoint simulates an ambient boost such as:
   - Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting
   - Thermal gradients
   - Piezoelectric generation
   - Capacitive coupling from environmental EM fields

3. **Total Energy is Always Bounded**  
   At no point does the system exceed injected + ambient energy. This simulation remains physically plausible.

## Why This Isn't Perpetual Motion

- The system **loses** energy per loop due to decay.
- The checkpoints **add** a small, plausible amount of energy back.
- The result is not infinite motion, but **prolonged motion** — akin to regenerative braking in electric vehicles or passive solar heating.

## Scientific Inspiration

- **RF Energy Harvesting**:  
  Research shows that RF ambient energy can power low-draw devices. This inspired the simulated "checkpoint" boost logic.

- **Distributed Energy Injection**:  
  Systems like Tesla’s distributed supercapacitor charging, and solar-wired microcontrollers, use similar energy-flow logic.

## Conceptual Accuracy

IX-T doesn’t cheat physics — it simulates what is physically feasible:
- Delayed energy exhaustion via small ambient inputs
- Modular energy checkpoint design
- Clear decay simulation without faking efficiency

---

## Next Validation Step

The next step is to move this simulation toward physical validation with:
- RF harvesting hardware
- Decay-measuring sensors
- Field-isolated testing environments

IX-T proposes a model — but we welcome the world to build and prove.
