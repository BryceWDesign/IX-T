# IX-T Validation Methods

This document defines structured procedures to validate the core claims of the IX-T system. It is designed to enable reproducible testing by independent labs, researchers, or scientific reviewers.

---

## 🔌 Validation Goals

- Confirm that energy harvested at checkpoints significantly offsets loop decay.
- Validate that checkpoint logic consumes less power than it contributes.
- Demonstrate operational extension of a low-power circuit over time.

---

## 🧪 Test Setup

### Hardware
- IX-T prototype board with 3 checkpoint modules
- Reference board with identical base circuit, but no checkpoints
- Ambient energy source (RF emitter, heated/cool plates, vibration source)
- Oscilloscope, multimeter, INA219 or similar power monitoring IC

### Baseline Environment
- Indoor lab setup with temperature control and noise isolation
- Loop system powered by initial supercapacitor charge (no external power input)
- Logging of voltage levels at each cycle and energy consumption over time

## ✅ Procedure 1: Energy Offset Validation

1. Power IX-T and reference circuit with identical initial charge.
2. Expose both to ambient energy sources at controlled levels.
3. Log voltage decay over 50 loop cycles.
4. Calculate energy gain/loss per cycle using INA219 data.
5. Compare decay slopes to assess energy offset ratio.

**Pass Criteria**:  
- IX-T circuit shows ≥ 50% offset of energy lost vs baseline.

## ✅ Procedure 2: Harvesting Cost/Benefit Analysis

1. Disconnect checkpoints from main loop.
2. Measure energy harvested vs energy consumed by the checkpoint circuitry over 10 cycles.
3. Repeat for each ambient energy source type.

**Pass Criteria**:  
- Checkpoint system harvests ≥ 5× more energy than it uses.

---

## ✅ Procedure 3: Lifespan Extension Test

1. Fully charge the system’s supercapacitor.
2. Allow loop to run until reaching 50% voltage drop.
3. Record total operational time for IX-T vs baseline.
4. Repeat test 5× to establish statistical repeatability.

**Pass Criteria**:  
- IX-T circuit sustains operation ≥ 2× longer than baseline.

## 🧠 Advanced Validation Options

- Run tests under Martian atmospheric simulation
- Add sensors at checkpoints to log dynamic yield
- Use RF-isolated chamber to test “no ambient” baseline

---

## 📌 Summary

These validation methods ensure IX-T’s claims are:
- **Measurable**
- **Reproducible**
- **Open to scientific scrutiny**

Independent verification of these methods would demonstrate IX-T’s potential beyond theoretical interest — toward functional ambient augmentation in constrained systems.
